# Build a TOTP service

Use the top-notch security that CipherTrust Manager provides to build a time-based OTP service for your users' multi-factor authentication.

Time-based OTPs are a popular version of multi-factor authentication (MFA) used in many services today. The concept of generating them is simple, yet a single blunder could risk all your user's accounts.

## How do Time-based OTPs work?

Time-based OTP's work on a simple concept. When a users sets it up, the device (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, etc) and the server share a secret key. The key is then hashed with the time and the same code can be generated on the server and the user's client device.

### Single Point of Failiure
If a bad actor gains access to the servers or databases where you store all the secret keys used to generate the OTPs, now all your users accounts could get compromised!

### How do we fix this ðŸ‘‰ Use a KEY MANAGER
Key Managers like the [CipherTrust Platform](https://ciphertrust.io/) are designed to store cryptographic keys very securely. This demo is an example where I use the CipherTrust platform to store keys and generate time based OTP codes.

## Quick Start
This tutorial assumes that you've already setup the CipherTrust Platform. If not, check out our other <u>[step-by-step tutorials](../category/deploy-ciphertrust-platform)</u> that show you how to deploy CipherTrust.
### Step 1 - Clone the demo
Clone the demo project from the learn-ciphertrust repository
```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/ThalesGroup/learn-ciphertrust.git && cd learn-ciphertrust/learn/key-management/totp-demo/
```

### Step 2 - Install the required packages
The important packages that are necessary for this demo:
- `jsonwebtoken` - helps authenticate with the CipherTrust Platform's APIs.
- `otplib` - JavaScript implementation of the cryptographic timebased-otp standard (AKA - the library that calculates the one time code for the next 30 secs)
```bash title="Terminal"
npm install
```

### Step 3 - Configure your CipherTrust credentials in the .env file
```bash title="Terminal"
cp .env.example .env
```
Now update the `.env` file with your CipherTrust credentials. 

### Step 3 - Run dev server
Spin up the demo
```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

## Breaking down the demo
Now that you've got the demo setup and played around with it, let's understand how it works. The demo application involves 3 important code-blocks.


### Autheticating with CipherTrust Platform's APIs
Create a JWT (JSON Web Token) to be able to authenticate and communicate with the CipherTrust Platform's APIs.

```js title="./src/utils/create-jwt.js"
import axios from "axios";

// `createJWT` is a helper function that creates a JWT.
// This function must only called on the server. 
// If you call it on the client-side you will expose your username and password in every request. DO NOT DO THIS. Just use it in a server-side API call.
async function createJWT() {
    const response = await axios.post(
        `${process.env.CTM_URL}/api/v1/auth/tokens`,
        {
            username: process.env.CTM_USERNAME,
            password: process.env.CTM_PASSWORD,
        }
    ).catch(err => {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(502).send(err.toString());
    });

    const token = response.data.jwt;

    return token
}

export default createJWT;
```

:::info

Remember to replace `process.env.CTM_USERNAME` and `process.env.CTM_PASSWORD` with your CipherTrust Manager username and password or update it in your the `.env` file

### Creating and Exporting Cryptographic keys
To initiate the time-based OTP setup, a symmetric key (such as AES256) would be needed, so over here, we create and export a new key on the CipherTrust Platform using the API.
```js title="./src/utils/create-jwt.js"
import axios from 'axios';

async function createKey(keyname, jwt) {
    // /api/create-key-proxy rewrites to https://<your_ciphertrust_url>/api/v1/vault/keys2
    // This is done to avoid CORS errors thrown by the browser in the client side.
    const response = await axios.post(
        `/api/create-key-proxy`,
        {
            "name": keyname,
            "algorithm": "aes",
        },
        {
            headers: {
                "Authorization": `Bearer ${jwt}`
            }
        }
    ).catch(err => {
        console.error("Error creating key: ", err);
        return false
    })

    // Export key from CipherTrust Manager
    // /api/export-key-proxy/<keyId> rewrites to https://<your_ciphertrust_url>/api/v1/vault/keys2/<keyId>/export
    // This is done to avoid CORS errors thrown by the browser in the client side.
    const exportResponse = await axios.post(
        `/api/export-key-proxy/${keyname}`,
        {},
        {
            headers: {
                "Authorization": `Bearer ${jwt}`
            }
        }
    ).catch(err => {
        console.error("Error exporting key: ", err);
        return false;
    })

    return exportResponse.data.material;
    

}

export { createKey };
```

Then we load that key into a QR code using the `otplib` library. Now we have finished setting up a TOTP service using the secure CipherTrust platform as our key manager.
